# Data Visualisation for Data Science

Visualisation plays a key component during the entire data science process - in exploratory data analysis, model visualisation as well as in communicating the results through a narrative or a dashboard. The goal of this workshop is to help you gain a deeper understanding on the art and science of data visualisation.
